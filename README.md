Introduction
Coding Blox is an online coding platform that allows users to sign up, create coding contests, and participate in contests hosted by others. The platform manages users, questions, and contests while ensuring functionality for score calculation, leaderboards, and contest histories.

Functionalities
1. User Management
Command: CreateUser <user_name>

Example:
CreateUser Ross
CreateUser Monica
2. Question Management
Command: CreateQuestion <difficulty_level> <score>

Description: Creates a new question with a specific difficulty level and score.

Auto-increment: Question IDs start from 1.

Example:

CreateQuestion LOW 10
CreateQuestion HIGH 50
Command: ListQuestion <difficulty_level>

Description: Lists all questions or filters them by difficulty level.

Example:

ListQuestion LOW
ListQuestion
3. Contest Management
Command: CreateContest <contest_name> <contest_level> <contest_creator_user_name>

Description: Creates a new contest with the given difficulty level and registers the creator as a participant.

Auto-increment: Contest IDs start from 1.

Example:

CreateContest "diwali_contest" LOW Ross
CreateContest "christmas_contest" HIGH Monica
Command: ListContest <difficulty_level>

Description: Lists all contests or filters them by difficulty level.

Example:

ListContest LOW
ListContest
4. Contest Participation
Command: AttendContest <contest_id> <user_name>

Description: Allows users to register for a contest. The creator is automatically registered.

Example:

AttendContest 1 Monica

Example:

WithdrawContest 1 Joey
5. Running a Contest
Command: RunContest <contest_id> <contest_creator_user_name>
Description: Starts the contest if initiated by the creator. Updates user scores based on questions solved.
Score Calculation:
LOW: newScore = currentScore + (currentContestPoints - 50)
MEDIUM: newScore = currentScore + (currentContestPoints - 30)
HIGH: newScore = currentScore + (currentContestPoints)
Example:
RunContest 1 Ross
6. Leaderboard
Command: LeaderBoard <sorting_order>
Description: Displays a leaderboard sorted by score in ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order.
Example:
LeaderBoard desc

Example:
ContestHistory 1
Output:
"Joey" : 65 [2,4,6]
"Ross" : 35 [1,3,5]
"Monica": 25 [1,3,6]
Bonus Functionalities
Randomized Question Solving: Generates random solved questions for each participant during the contest.
Robust Score Calculation: Final scores are derived using the formula based on contest difficulty.
Design Considerations
Modularity: Each functionality is implemented in its own class or method to ensure single responsibility.
Extensibility: Interfaces and contracts are used to allow easy addition or modification of features.
Error Handling: Edge cases are handled gracefully, ensuring robustness.
Readability: The code follows standard conventions and is DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).
